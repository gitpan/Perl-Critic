ABOUT

  	Perl::Critic is an extensible framework for creating and
	applying coding standards to Perl source code.  It is,
	essentially, an automated code review.  Perl::Critic is
	distributed with a number of "Policy" modules that enforce the
	guidelines in Damian Conway's book "Perl Best Practices".
	Your shop can choose and customize those Polices through the
	Perl::Critic configuration interface.  You are also free to
	publish new "Policy" modules for others to use.  Enjoy.

PREREQUISITES

	Perl::Critic requires the following modules:
  	* List::MoreUtils
 	* List::Util
	* Config::Tiny
	* File::Spec
	* PPI

 	For extra tests during the build, I also recommend:
	* Test::Pod::Coverage
	* Test::Pod

INSTALLATION

	For installation instructions, see the INSTALL file.

BUGS

	Bugs should be reported to http://rt.cpan.org

	For all the gory details, see the POD documentation scattered
	throughout this distribution.
