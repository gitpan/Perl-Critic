[0.01] Released on 050816.

	Initial version.

[0.02] Released on 050913.

	Major overhaul based on feedback from Perl community.

	Factored coding standards into separate modules (known as
	Policies).  The idea here is to allow other developers to easily
	contribute additional coding standards.

	Reworked Perl::Review into a simple engine for loading and running
	Policy modules.

	Gave perlreview a command-line interface and configuration file
	for selecting which Policy modules to use.

[0.03] Released on 050913.

	Fixed some POD links.  

	Removed test cases for missing policy module.

[0.04] Released on 050914

	Version 0.03 was a bust because I uploaded the wrong tarball to PAUSE.

[0.05] Released on 050917

	End of 'Perl::Review' releases.  I have changed the name to
	'Perl::Critic' to avoid possible confusion with "The Perl Review"
	magazine.

[0.06] Released on 050917

	Now called 'Perl::Critic'.  

	Added 4 new policy modules.  
	
	Fixed bugs in build process.  

	Added support for Module::Build.

[0.07] Released on 050921

	Fixed bugs in the ProhibitCascadingIfElse policy.  

	Added ProhibitExplicitReturnUndef policy

	Made ProhibitUnpackagedCode configurable so you can exempt scripts,
	which typically don't have an explicit 'package' statement.

	ProhibitPackageVars policy now exempts vars in ALL_CAPS.  This
	is to permit common package variables like @EXPORT and $VERSION.

	Renamed "ProhibitStringyGrep and "ProhibitStringyMap" because 
	the so-called string form doesn't really exist.  Now called
	"RequireBlockGrep" and "RequireBlockMap" 

	Corrected documentation on defining Policy names within the 
	configuration file.  This still isn't very clear and needs
	to be rewritten.

	Perl::Critic now requires PPI version 1.003, which has a few bug 
	fixes of its own.

	Rewrite some code just to make Perl::Critic more self-compliant.

	Added test cases to verify the configuration functionality.  These
	are not completely thorough and need more work.

[0.08_01] Not released

	Fixed "ProhibitParensWithBuiltins" to allow parens to be used with
	object method calls that have the same name as a builtin functions.

	Introduced magical comments that allow developers to configure 
	Perl::Critic on-the-fly from within their code.

	Added META.yml files and POD tests to the build.  I did this
	mostly just to boost the Kwalitee score on CPANTS.

	Switched from "Config::Std" to "Config::Tiny" because it doesn't
	require those fancy Damian modules that don't seem to work on
	some older versions of Perl.

[0.08_2] Released 050927

	Fixed problems with Perl::Critic::Config that caused File::Spec
	to emit 'uninitialized value' warnings during the build.

	Added 1 Policy module contributed by Graham TerMarsch

	Switched from File::Spec::Functions to plain File::Spec because
	I think its usage is more common.

	Removed 'FindBin' from the test files so I can be sure that the
	right libraries are getting loaded.  This means I'll have to
	use the -l option with C<prove>.

	Edited more POD.

[0.09] Released 051004

        Fixed several bugs:
	  * 14810: Now you are allowed to create your own 'import' function,
	           since this is frequently done with fancy modules.
	  * 14817: Parens and brackets not considered noise, since they
                   look better in quotes anyway.
          * 14787: $1 and '_' are exempt from PunctuationVars
          * 14899: Object methods with the same name as a built-in can
                   be called with parens (kinda have to anyway).

        New features:
          * 14734: Limit for number separators is now configurable

        New Policy modules:
          * CodeLayout::ProhibitHardTabs
          * ControlStructures::ProhibitUnlessBlocks
          * ControlStructures::ProhibitUntilBlocks
          * ControlStructures::ProhibitCStyleForLoops

        Changed the syntax for the magic comments.  Adam had the
	idea of using a pragma-like notation.  I liked it.
