[0.01] Released on 050816.

	Initial version.

[0.02] Released on 050913.

	Major overhaul based on feedback from Perl community.

	Factored coding standards into separate modules (known as
	Policies).  The idea here is to allow other developers to easily
	contribute additional coding standards.

	Reworked Perl::Review into a simple engine for loading and running
	Policy modules.

	Gave perlreview a command-line interface and configuration file
	for selecting which Policy modules to use.

[0.03] Released on 050913.

	Fixed some POD links.  

	Removed test cases for missing policy module.

[0.04] Released on 050914

	Version 0.03 was a bust because I uploaded the wrong tarball to PAUSE.

[0.05] Released on 050917

	End of 'Perl::Review' releases.  I have changed the name to
	'Perl::Critic' to avoid possible confusion with "The Perl Review"
	magazine.

[0.06] Released on 050917

	Now called 'Perl::Critic'.  

	Added 4 new policy modules.  
	
	Fixed bugs in build process.  

	Added support for Module::Build.

[0.07] Released on 050921

	Fixed bugs in the ProhibitCascadingIfElse policy.  

	Added ProhibitExplicitReturnUndef policy

	Made ProhibitUnpackagedCode configurable so you can exempt scripts,
	which typically don't have an explicit 'package' statement.

	ProhibitPackageVars policy now exempts vars in ALL_CAPS.  This
	is to permit common package variables like @EXPORT and $VERSION.

	Renamed "ProhibitStringyGrep and "ProhibitStringyMap" because 
	the so-called string form doesn't really exist.  Now called
	"RequireBlockGrep" and "RequireBlockMap" 

	Corrected documentation on defining Policy names within the 
	configuration file.  This still isn't very clear and needs
	to be rewritten.

	Perl::Critic now requires PPI version 1.003, which has a few bug 
	fixes of its own.

	Rewrite some code just to make Perl::Critic more self-compliant.

	Added test cases to verify the configuration functionality.  These
	are not completely thorough and need more work.
