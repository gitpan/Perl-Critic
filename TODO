POLICIES TO ADD:

- Require labels for loops.
- Require labels for loop breaks.
- Require global variables to be localized
- Prohibit one-argument 'bless'
- Prohibit two-argument 'open'
- Prohibit 'no strict'
- Prohibit 'no warnings'
- Require fat commas for hashes
- Require trailing comma for lists
- Add the rest of Graham's policy modules

NEW FEATURES:

- "verbose" mode, with more diagnostic information.  Maybe extract POD.
- Report safari sections instead of book page numbers.

OTHER SHIT:

As the number of policy modules grow, the performance of Perl::Critic
is rapidly deteriorating.  This is because each Policy traverses the
PDOM tree, possibly several times.  I think the solution is to move
towards a stream-based approach, where the PDOM tree is traversed once
and all Policies are evaluated at each node.
