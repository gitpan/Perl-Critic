THINGS TO DO

I dropped some of the policies that were included in version 0.01
because I haven't figured out how to make them reliable.  Most of the
problems have to do with variations in Perl syntax that mean the same
thing, but PPI represents them differently.  PPI has a normalization
method, but it doesn't handle my needs (yet).

There are a lot of policy modules that can be written.  Some of the
more doable policies from Perl Best Practices are:

-Require labels for loops.
-Require labels for loop breaks.
-Prohibit C-style for loops.
-Require global variables to be localized
-Prohibit 'unless' blocks (non postfix)
-Prohibit 'until' blocks (non postfix)
-Prohibit one-argument 'bless'
-Prohibit two-argument 'open'
-Prohibit 'no strict'
-Prohibit 'no warnings'
-Require fat commas for hashes
-Require trailing comma for lists
